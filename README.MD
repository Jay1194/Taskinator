# Password-Generator

## Description
I have developed an online project tracker that employs the Kanban methodology. In essence, the Kanban board facilitates the movement of distinct work units across columns that convey various statuses like "To Do," "In Progress," or "Complete." This application seamlessly integrates web APIs, enabling the exchange of data with external services. Additionally, it leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and create an engaging user interface.
